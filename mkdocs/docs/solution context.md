## Solution context.

The whole world is experiencing an energy crisis, and all organizations,
think day and night about alternative solutions to ensure an energetically reassuring future for up coming
human generations while keeping our planet a healthy place to live in. At the same time, technology
itself is developing at enormous speed, today people in companies are thinking of ecological solutions
and at the same time autonomous in terms of process which require less human intervention, in other words it must be guided by itself. Recently, I have been working on the relation between the energy saving and intelligence, and how we can thanks to the help of AI make systems to control over our daily use of energy, considering that fuel gas is actually running out and our need for more clean resources to produce energy.
Whatâ€™s the relation between saving energy and producing energy??

Actually, the way how we use energy, is only what can define how we will produce it. It is an indirect way to reduce our need for energy, which is basically the final goal! 

This model was developped as result of thinking of solutions that resemble the two aspects of a smart energy efficiency: minimize energy consumption and the autonomy aspect: operating without human intervention.

This solution is to prove that we can manage energy usage based on an artificial intelligence model. It can be scalled to more dedicated scenarios in a broad sense like export and import energy between countries which will then better manage the national grid or international transport of energy reducing though the charges involved.

This type of solution is highly recommended, since it reduces electricity consumption, reduce human effort and consequently reduce work accidents, as well as making predictions energy related decisions in the future much more easy.
